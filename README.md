 Hello, thank you for the opportunity to work on these problems.
 How to run code:

 ```
  cd problem-[1/2]
  node app.js
 ```

## Problem-1
* Fill in the results for the following inputs:
* 2013-01: expected revenue: $8100, expected total capacity of the unreserved offices: 254

1. How much time did you spend?
   ~1h 30m.
2. What was the most difficult thing for you?
   Figuring out the calculation for total capacity of unreserved offices.
3. What technical debt would you pay if you had one more iteration?
   I would probably add CSV data validation.
